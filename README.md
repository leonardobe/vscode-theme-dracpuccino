## 🖌️ Overview

**Dracpuccino** is a custom Visual Studio Code theme that combines the best of two worlds:

- 🎨 **Syntax token colors** are fully based on the popular [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme, ensuring excellent readability and vibrant code highlighting.
- 🌌 **Dark user interface elements** (sidebar, status bar, panels) are inspired by the soft and cozy palette of [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/), providing a comfortable and modern environment for long coding sessions.
- ✨ **Customized colors** have been added to create a unique, personalized look that enhances visual harmony and user experience.
